    prompt: 'Extract every exact substring from {{ input.content }} that contains
      a measure or unit word (examples: drop, flock, minute, minutes, percent, dollar,

  - name: filter_concise_and_unique
    output_keys:
    - subtask_2_output
    prompt: From {{ input.content }}, select the most concise exact substrings (no
      more than 12 words) that clearly show the measurement or unit. Remove obvious
      duplicates and prefer the shortest clear phrase when multiple overlapping excerpts
      exist. Return a JSON array of the selected exact phrases only.
  - name: finalize_measure_words
    output_keys:
    - subtask_3_output
    prompt: From {{ input.content }}, produce the final list of exact, unique measure-word
      phrases suitable for downstream use. Ensure each item is an exact substring
      from the document, concise (<=12 words), contains a unit/collective, and there
      are no duplicates. Return a JSON array.

    validation_prompt: "You are a quality judge for a list of extracted measure expressions\
      \ called \"measure_words\" that were produced from a single source document.\
      \ Your job is to determine whether the list is correct and to provide precise,\
      \ actionable corrections if it is not.\n\nChecks to perform for each item:\n\
      1) Exact excerpt: Each item must be an exact substring taken from the source\
      \ document (no paraphrase). If an item is not an exact excerpt, mark it invalid\
      \ and supply the exact excerpt from the document that should replace it.\n2)\
      \ Contains a measure word: The excerpt must contain a word that denotes a unit,\
      \ measure, or collective (examples: drop, flock, minute/minutes, pound(s), percent,\
      \ units, people, nations). Purely numeric tokens alone (e.g., \"15,000\" with\
      \ no unit) are invalid.\n3) Conciseness: The excerpt should be a short phrase\
      \ that clearly shows the measurement (preferably no more than ~12 words). If\
      \ an item is overly long, suggest a shorter exact excerpt from the document\
      \ that preserves the measure.\n4) No duplicates: Remove duplicate excerpts.\n\
      \nDecision rule:\n- Return PASS only if every item passes all checks and there\
      \ are no duplicates.\n- Otherwise return FAIL.\n\nOutput format (must follow\
      \ exactly):\n- First line: either PASS or FAIL\n- If PASS: on the second line\
      \ write a brief one-line confirmation (e.g., \"All items are valid.\")\n- If\
      \ FAIL: on the second line output a JSON object with a single key \"feedback\"\
      \ whose value is a list of objects. Each object must include:\n  {\n    \"index\"\
      : <index of the problematic item in the provided list, zero-based>,\n    \"\
      issue\": \"short explanation of what is wrong (e.g., not an exact excerpt; missing\
      \ unit; purely numeric; duplicate; too long)\",\n    \"corrected\": \"the exact\
      \ excerpt from the original document that should replace this item (or null\
      \ if none found)\"\n  }\n- After the JSON feedback object, add one final short\
      \ sentence summarizing the top-level fixes needed.\n\nWhen suggesting \"corrected\"\
      \ excerpts, do not invent text; provide the exact substring as it appears in\
      \ the document. If multiple valid measure excerpts exist nearby, choose the\
      \ shortest clear phrase that contains the unit. If no suitable exact excerpt\
      \ exists for an item, set \"corrected\" to null and explain why in \"issue\"\
      .\n\nBe concise and precise so the upstream generator can use your feedback\
      \ to refine the list."
