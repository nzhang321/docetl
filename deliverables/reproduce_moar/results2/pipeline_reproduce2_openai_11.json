In just moments, the current U.S. president will debate the former U.S. president as their parties\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd presumptive nominees, a first in American history. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world to our studios in Atlanta. This is the CNN presidential debate. DANA BASH, CNN MODERATOR: This debate is being produced by CNN and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds coming to you live on CNN, CNN International, CNN.com, CNN Max, and CNN Espanol. This is a pivotal moment between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in their rematch for the nation\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds highest office. Each will make his case to the American people with just over four months until Election Day. Good evening. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm Dana Bash, anchor of CNN\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdInside Politics\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and co-anchor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdState Of The Union.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd TAPPER: I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm Jake Tapper, anchor of CNN\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe Lead\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and co-anchor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdState Of The Union.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Dana and I will co-moderate this evening. Our job is to facilitate a debate between the two candidates tonight. Before we introduce them, we want to share the rules of the debate with the ... it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a failing nation, but it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not going to be failing anymore. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make it great again.
