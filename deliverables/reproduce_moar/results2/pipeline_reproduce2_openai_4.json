    "content": "JAKE TAPPER, CNN MODERATOR: We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre live from Georgia, a key battleground state in the race for the White House. In just moments, the current U.S. president will debate the former U.S. president as their parties\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd presumptive nominees, a first in American history. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world to our studios in Atlanta. This is the CNN presidential debate. DANA BASH, CNN MODERATOR: This debate is being produced by CNN and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds coming to you live on CNN, CNN International, CNN.com, CNN Max, and CNN Espanol. This is a pivotal moment between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in their rematch for the nation\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds highest office. Each will make his case to the American people with just over four months until Election Day. Good evening. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm Dana Bash, anchor of CNN\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdInside Politics\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and co-anchor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdState Of The Union.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd TAPPER: I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm Jake Tapper, anchor of CNN\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe Lead\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and co-anchor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdState Of The Union.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Dana and I will co-moderate this evening. Our job is to facilitate a debate between the two candidates tonight. Before we introduce them, we want to share the rules of the debate with the audience at home. Former President Trump will be on the left side of the screen. President Biden will be appearing on the right. A coin toss determined their positions. Each candidate will have two minutes to answer a question, and one minute each for responses and rebuttals. An additional minute for follow-up, clarification or response is at the moderators\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd discretion. BASH: When it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds time for a candidate to speak, his microphone will be turned on and his opponent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds microphone will be turned off. Should a candidate interrupt when his microphone is muted, he will be difficult to understand for viewers at home. At the end of the debate, each candidate will get two minutes for closing statements. There is no studio audience tonight. Pre-written notes, props or contact with campaign staff are not permitted during the debate. By accepting our invitation to debate, both candidates and their campaigns agreed to accept these rules. TAPPER: Now please welcome the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: How are you? Good to be here. Thank you. TAPPER: And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds begin the debate. And let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy. President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then, now costs more than $12; and typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump? BIDEN: You have to take a look at what I was left when ... it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a failing nation, but it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not going to be failing anymore. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make it great again. BASH: Thank you, former President Trump, President Biden.",
