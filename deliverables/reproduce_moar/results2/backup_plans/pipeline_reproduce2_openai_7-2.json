    "content": "Each will make his case to the American people with just over four months until Election Day.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nach candidate will have two minutes to answer a question, and one minute each for responses and rebuttals. An additional minute for follow-up, clarification or response is at the moderators\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd discretion.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nFor example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then, now costs more than $12; and typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nThe pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nThere were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nWe created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nWorking class people are still in trouble.\nI come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd if things weren\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt able to be met during the month was a problem.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure we build 2 million new units.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nWe created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nThe only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs; they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre bounced back from the COVID.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nHe had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nHe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nnd the military \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nYou can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you.\nI want to follow up. You want to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nThat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taking credit for bounceback jobs. You can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do that.\nHe also said he inherited 9 percent inflation.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nAnd then it blew up under his leadership, because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what they were doing.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nHe got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds life.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nAnd according to a new non-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt. While so far, President Biden, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.\nSo former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\now, when we cut the taxes \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nemember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nHe did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nnd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nIDEN: He had the largest national debt of any president four-year period, number one.\nNumber two, he got $2 trillion tax cut, benefited the very wealthy.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nThey\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd raised $500 million \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nAnd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds destroying Medicare, because all of these people are coming in, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre putting them on Medicare, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre putting them on Social Security.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nThese millions and millions of people coming in, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre trying to put them on Social Security.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nForeign countries \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm friends with a lot of people.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nThey think we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre very stupid people.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nThat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the vote of the people.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nSome people \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you have to follow your heart. Some people don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt believe in that.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nSome people don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nhe problem they have is they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre radical, because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd after birth.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nRUMP: There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nut they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre voting and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt, but they would have \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd everybody want it brought back.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nnd again, this gives it the vote of the people.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nSecond time is between a doctor and an extreme situation.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nRUMP: So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat-run, take it after birth.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\no he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve changed it in a way that now you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\ne decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nAnd people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nBut the idea they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre emptying their prisons, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre welcoming these people, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds simply not true.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nDoes that mean that you will deport every undocumented immigrant in America, including those who have jobs, including those whose spouses are citizens, and including those who have lived here for decades? And if so, how will you do it?\nTRUMP: Can I get one second?\nHe said we killed three people. The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Salamani (sic), the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\ne\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the one that killed people with the bad border, including hundreds of thousands of people dying, and also killing our citizens when they come in.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nThey\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union, because we don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have borders anymore. Every state is now a border.\nAnd because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre killing our citizens at a level that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nAnd we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast, because they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to destroy our country.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nBut he has killed so many people at our border by allowing\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nTAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.\nTRUMP: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all of these people to come in.\nTAPPER: President Biden\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nTRUMP: And it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a very sad day in America.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nMy \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd my son spent a year in Iraq living next to one of those burn pits. Came back with stage four glioblastoma.\nI was recently in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in France for D-Day, and I spoke to all \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd about those heroes that died.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nHe was standing with his four-star general, and he told him \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he said, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want to go in there because they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre a bunch of losers and suckers.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nWe had 19 people that said I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say it.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\no think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we have 19 people that said it was never said by me.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nI want to begin with Russia\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds war against Ukraine, which is now in its third year.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nlot of people are dead right now, much more than people know.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nAnd by the way, we left people behind too.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nASH: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to come back to you for one minute.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nHe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds given $200 billion.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nEvery time that Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion.\n\n--- SNIPPET ---\n\nPeople being killed so needlessly, so stupidly, and I will get it settled and I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll get it settled fast, before I take office.\nBASH: President Biden, you have a minute.",
