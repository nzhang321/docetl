In just moments, the current U.S. president will debate the former U.S. president as their parties\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd presumptive nominees, a first in American history. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world to our studios in Atlanta. This is the CNN presidential debate. DANA BASH, CNN MODERATOR: This debate is being produced by CNN and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds coming to you live on CNN, CNN International, CNN.com, CNN Max, and CNN Espanol. This is a pivotal moment between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in their rematch for the nation\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds highest office. Each will make his case to the American people with just over four months until Election Day. Good evening. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm Dana Bash, anchor of CNN\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdInside Politics\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and co-anchor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdState Of The Union.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd TAPPER: I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm Jake Tapper, anchor of CNN\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe Lead\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and co-anchor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdState Of The Union.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Dana and I will co-moderate this evening. Our job is to facilitate a debate between the two candidates tonight. Before we introduce them, we want to share the rules of the debate with the audience at home. Former President Trump will be on the left side of the screen. President Biden will be appearing on the right. A coin toss determined their positions. Each candidate will have two minutes to answer a question, and one minute each for responses and rebuttals. An additional minute for follow-up, clarification or response is at the moderators\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd discretion. BASH: When it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds time for a candidate to speak, his microphone will be turned on and his opponent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds microphone will be turned off. Should a candidate interrupt when his microphone is muted, he will be difficult to understand for viewers at home. At the end of the debate, each candidate will get two minutes for closing statements. There is no studio audience tonight. Pre-written notes, props or contact with campaign staff are not permitted during the debate. By accepting our invitation to debate, both candidates and their campaigns agreed to accept these rules. TAPPER: Now please welcome the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: How are you? Good to be here. Thank you. TAPPER: And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds begin the debate. And let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy. President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then, now costs more than $12; and typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump? BIDEN: You have to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me. We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be all right. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible. And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds more to be done. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd if things weren\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt take over. The combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in this problem right now. In addition to that, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where if you had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do much at all. By the time he left, there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd things had been in chaos. There was (ph) literally chaos. And so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year. And the situation is making \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to get done. TAPPER: Thank you. President Trump? DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had never done so well. Every \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us. We got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt end up in a Great Depression the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd so we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good. But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates; that was a disaster for our country. But other than that, we had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we had given them back a \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs; they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre bounced back from the COVID. He has not done a good job. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done a poor job. And inflation\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds killing our country. It is absolutely killing us. TAPPER: Thank you. President Biden? BIDEN: Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only one who thinks that, I think. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know anybody else who thinks it was great \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he had the greatest economy in the world. And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised ... largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history. The reason he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds putting a lot of those regulations back on. All of the things that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done, nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd never seen anything like \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre terminally ill. Now, you can go and you can get something. You sign a document. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been trying to get it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a failing nation, but it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not going to be failing anymore. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make it great again. BASH: Thank you, former President Trump, President Biden.",
