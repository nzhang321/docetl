Each will make his case to the American people with just over four months until Election Day.\nGood evening. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm Dana Bash, anchor of CNN\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdInside Politics\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and co-anchor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdState Of The Union.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nTAPPER:  I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm Jake Tapper, anchor of CNN\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe Lead\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and co-anchor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdState Of The Union.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nDana and I will co-moderate this evening. Our job is to facilitate a debate between the two candidates tonight.\nBefore we introduce them, we want to share the rules of the debate with the audience at home.\nFormer President Trump will be on the left side of the screen. President Biden will be appearing on the right. A coin toss determined their positions.\nEach candidate will have two minutes to answer a question, and one minute each for responses and rebuttals. An additional minute for follow-up, clarification or response is at the moderators\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd discretion.\nBASH:  When it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds time for a candidate to speak, his microphone will be turned on and his opponent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds microphone will be turned off. Should a candidate interrupt when his microphone is muted, he will be difficult to understand for viewers at home.\nAt the end of the debate, each candidate will get two minutes for closing statements.\nThere is no studio audience tonight. Pre-written notes, props or contact with campaign staff are not permitted during the debate.\nBy accepting our invitation to debate, both candidates and their campaigns agreed to accept these rules.\nTAPPER:  Now please welcome the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden.\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: How are you? Good to be here. Thank you.\nTAPPER:  And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump.\nGentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds begin the debate. And let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy.\nPresident Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then, now costs more than $12; and typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent.\nWhat do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?\nBIDEN:  You have to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me.\nWe had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be all right.\nThe economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible.\nAnd so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.\nBut there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds more to be done. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble.\nI come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd if things weren\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.\nThat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt take over.\nThe combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in this problem right now.\nIn addition to that, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where if you had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do much at all. By the time he left, there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd things had been in chaos. There was (ph) literally chaos.\nAnd so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year.\nAnd the situation is making \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to get done.\nTAPPER:  Thank you.\nPresident Trump?\nDONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had never done so well. Every \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us.\nWe got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt end up\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nand we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates; that was a disaster for our country.\nBut other than that, we had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we had given them back a \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs; they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre bounced back from the COVID.\nHe has not done a good job. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done a poor job. And inflation\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.\nTAPPER:  Thank you.\nPresident Biden?\nBIDEN:  Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only one who thinks that, I think. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know anybody else who thinks it was great \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he had the greatest economy in the world.\nAnd, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant.\nAnd the military \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. He didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do anything about that. When he was president, we still found ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country. The truth is, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm the only president this century that doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have any \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this decade \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did.\nTAPPER:  President Trump, I want to follow up, if I can. You wanted\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nTRUMP:  Am I allowed to respond to him?\nTAPPER:  Well, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to ask you a follow-up. You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you.\nI want to follow up. You want to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. How will you ensure that that doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt drive prices even higher?\nTRUMP:  Not going to drive them higher. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China and many others, in all fairness to China \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things.\nBut he \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taking credit for bounceback jobs. You can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do that.\nHe also said he inherited 9 percent inflation. No, he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership, because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what they were doing. And they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what they were doing. It was the worst \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd probably the worst administration in history. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds never been.\nAnd as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power. He got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds life.\nTAPPER:  President Trump, over the last eight years, under both of your administrations, the national debt soared to record highs. And according to a new non-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt. While so far, President Biden, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.\nSo former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say. With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?\nTRUMP:  Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that tax spurred.\nNow, when we cut the taxes \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country.\nThe country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation, with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with. We \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we gave him something great.\nRemember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration.\nHe did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job.\nAnd I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre no longer respected as a country. They don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt respect our leadership. They don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt respect the United States anymore.\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre like a Third World nation. Between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent, all of the things he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve become like a Third World nation. And it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a shame the damage he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done to our country.\nAnd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.\nTAPPER:  President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block.\nPresident Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.\nBIDEN:  He had the largest national debt of any president four-year period, number one.\nNumber two, he got $2 trillion tax cut, benefited the very wealthy.\nWhat I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to do is fix the taxes.\nFor example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I mean, billionaires in America. And what\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds happening? They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd raised $500 million \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be able to right \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd wipe out his debt. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be able to help make sure that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all those things we need to do, childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been able to do with the COVID \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with.\nLook, if \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we finally beat Medicare.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden.\nPresident Trump?\nTRUMP:  Well, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds right: He did beat Medicaid (ph). He beat it to death. And he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds destroying Medicare, because all of these people are coming in, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre putting them on Medicare, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre putting them on Social Security. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to destroy Social Security.\nThis man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence, and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a shame.\nWhat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre no longer respected. They don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like us. We give them everything they want, and they \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they think we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre stupid. They think we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre very stupid people.\nWhat we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us. What this man has done is absolutely criminal.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\nDana?\nBASH:  This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case, temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho despite that state\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds restrictive ban.\nFormer President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wa\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\ns president, would you block abortion medication?\nTRUMP:  First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.\nAnd if you look at this whole question that you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre asking, a complex, but not really complex \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders.\nAnd what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.\nNow, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd getting into other things, But every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that.\nNow the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the vote of the people.\nLike Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds important to believe in the exceptions. Some people \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you have to follow your heart. Some people don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. I think it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds very important. Some people don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt. Follow your heart.\nBut you have to get elected also and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd because that has to do with other things. You got to get elected.\nThe problem they have is they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre radical, because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd after birth.\nIf you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll put the baby aside and we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll kill the baby.\nWhat happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds been a great thing.\nBASH:  Thank you.\nPresident Biden?\nBIDEN:  It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds been a terrible thing what you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done.\nThe fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe. And I was \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous.\nAnd this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a state where in six weeks you don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt even know whether you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor, have your \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help.\nThe idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to turn civil rights back to the states, let each state have a different rule.\nLook, there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds so many young women who have been \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by \u00ef\u00bf\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nby their in-laws, by their \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd just \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds just \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it. And they try to arrest them when they cross state lines.\nBASH:  Thank you.\nTRUMP:  There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border. We have a border that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the most dangerous place anywhere in the world \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world. And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country, and they are raping and killing women. And it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a terrible thing.\nAs far as the abortion\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting and in many cases, they \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds, frankly, a very liberal decision. In many cases, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the opposite.\nBut they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre voting and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt, but they would have \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd everybody want it brought back.\nRonald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt able to get it.\nEverybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back. I was the one to do it.\nAnd again, this gives it the vote of the people. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds where they wanted it. Every legal scholar wanted it that way.\nBASH:  Staying on the topic of abortion, President Biden, seven states \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll let you do that. This is the same topic.\nSeven states have no legal restrictions on how far into a pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion. Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy?\nBIDEN:  I supported Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters.\nFirst time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation. A third time is between the doctor \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I mean, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be between the woman and the state.\nThe idea that the politicians \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a woman\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds health is ridiculous. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the last \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd no politician should be making that decision. A doctor should be making those decisions. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds how it should be run. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to do.\nAnd if I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm elected, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to restore Roe v. Wade.\nTRUMP:  So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat-run, take it after birth. Again, the governor \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd former governor of Virginia:  put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it.\nSo he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.\nNobody wants that to happen. Democrat or Republican, nobody wants it to happen.\nBIDEN:  He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds lying. That is simply not true.\nThat \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Roe v. Wade does not provide for that. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not the circumstance. Only when the woman\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds life is in danger, she\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to die, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only circumstance in which that can happen.\nBut we are not for late-term abortion, period, period, period.\nTRUMP:  Under Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want.\nWe don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a good thing. We think it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans.\nBIDEN:  For 51 years, that was the law. 51 years, constitutional scholarship said it was the right way to go. 51 years. And it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. Takes credit for taking it away.\nWhat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds he going to do? What\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds he going to do, in fact, if \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd if the MAGA Republicans \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he gets elected, and the MAGA Republicans control the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or 10 weeks, something very, very conservative? Is he going to sign that bill? I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll veto it. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll sign it.\nBASH:  Thank you.\nTAPPER:  Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds turn now to the issue of immigration and border security.\nPresident Biden, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch, overwhelming border states and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago, and in some cases causing real safety and security concerns. Given that, why should voters trust you to solve this cri\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\ne was taking \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not the right way to go.\nWhat I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd since I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve changed the law, what\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds happened? I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve changed it in a way that now you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds better than when he left office. And I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the total initiative relative to what we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers.\nTAPPER:  President Trump?\nTRUMP:  I really don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think he knows what he said either.\nLook, we had the safest border in the history of our country. The border \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all he had to do was leave it. All he had to do was leave it.\nHe decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists. We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists, all over the world \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere. All over the world, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre pouring in. And this guy just left it open.\nAnd he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt need legislation because I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have legislation. I said, close the border. We had the safest border in history. In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd who is great, and, by the way, who endorsed me for president. But I won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say that. But they endorsed me for president.\nBrandon, just speak to him.\nBut, look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds never been anything like it. And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\nPresident Biden?\nBIDEN:  The only terrorist who has done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three in his administration, killed \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd an al-Qaida person in his administration killed three American soldiers, killed three American soldiers. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only terrorist that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds there.\nI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not saying no terrorist ever got through. But the idea they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre emptying their prisons, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre welcoming these people, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds simply not true. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds no data to support what he said.\nOnce again, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds exaggerating. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds lying.\nTAPPER:  President Trump, staying on the topic of immigration, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve said that you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to carry out, quote, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe largest domestic deportation operation in American history,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd unquote. Does that mean that you will deport every undocumented immigrant in America, including those who have jobs, including those whose spouses are citizens, and including those who have lived here for decades? And if so, how will you do it?\nTRUMP:  Can I get one second?\nHe said we killed three people. The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Salamani (sic), the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world. And it had a huge impact on everything; not just border, on everything.\nHe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the one that killed people with the bad border, including hundreds of thousands of people dying, and also killing our citizens when they come in. We \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we are living right now in a rat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nest. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union, because we don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have borders anymore. Every state is now a border.\nAnd because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre killing our citizens at a level that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen. We call it migrant crime. I call it Biden migrant crime.\nThey\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre killing our citizens at a level that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen before. And you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days. One of them, I just spoke to the mother, and we just had the funeral for this girl, 12 years old.\nThis is horrible what\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taken place. What\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taken place in our country, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre literally an uncivilized country now.\nHe doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want it to be. He just doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know. He opened the borders nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever seen anything like. And we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast, because they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to destroy our country.\nJust take a look at where they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places. Our veterans are on the street, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre dying, because he doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt care about our veterans. He doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt care. He doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like the military at all. And he doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt care about our veterans.\nNobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds been worse. I had the highest approval rating for veterans, taking care of the V.A. He has the worst. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds gotten rid of all the things that I approved, choice, that I got through Congress. All of the different things I approved, they abandoned.\nWe had, by far, the highest, and now it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds down in less than half because he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all these great things that we did \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy. But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\nTRUMP:  \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all of these people to come in.\nTAPPER:  President Biden\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nTRUMP:  And it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a very sad day in America.\nTAPPER:  President Biden, you have the mic.\nBIDEN:  Every single thing he said is a lie, every single one.\nFor example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act. One million of them now have insurance, and their families have it \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and their families have it. Because what happened, whether was Agent Orange or burn pits, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre all being covered now. And he opposed \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd his group opposed that.\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd my son spent a year in Iraq living next to one of those burn pits. Came back with stage four glioblastoma.\nI was recently in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in France for D-Day, and I spoke to all \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd about those heroes that died. I went to the World War II cemetery \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd World War I cemetery he refused to go to. He was standing with his four-star general, and he told him \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he said, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want to go in there because they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre a bunch of losers and suckers.\nMy son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre the sucker. You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre the loser.\nTAPPER:  President Trump?\nTRUMP:  First of all, that was a made-up quote, suckers and losers. They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds failing, like many of these magazines. He made that up. He put it in commercials. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve notified them. We had 19 people that said I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say it.\nAnd think of this, who would say \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm at a cemetery, or I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm talking about our veterans \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd because nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taken better care \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm so glad this came up, and he brought it up. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nobody that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taken better care of our soldiers than I have.\nTo think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we have 19 people that said it was never said by me. It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up, just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking.\nIt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the same thing. Fifty-one intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation. It wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt. That came from his son Hunter. It wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt Russia disinformation. He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now.\nBIDEN:  You had a four-star\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\n\u00bf\u00bds what we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what the V.A. is doing now. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.\nTAPPER:  All right. Thank you so much.\nBASH:  Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds move to the topic of foreign policy. I want to begin with Russia\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds war against Ukraine, which is now in its third year.\nFormer President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin says he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll only end this war if Russia keeps the Ukrainian territory it has already claimed and Ukraine abandons its bid to join NATO.\nAre Putin\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds terms acceptable to you?\nTRUMP:  First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt stand this guy. They can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt stand him. They think he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the worst commander in chief, if that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what you call him, that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever had. They can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt stand him. So let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds get that straight.\nAnd they like me more than just about any of them. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds based on every single bit of information.\nAs far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that was respected by Putin, he would have never \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he would have never invaded Ukraine.\nA lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know. You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers. He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.\nI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned, and so he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals.\nNo general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind, we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And by the way, we left people behind too. We left American citizens behind.\nWhen Putin saw that, he said, you know what? I think we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to go in and maybe take my \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never.\nJust like Israel would have never been invaded, in a million years, by Hamas. You know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror.\nThat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why you had no terror at all during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.\nBASH:  President Biden?\nBIDEN:  I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never heard so much malarkey in my whole life.\nLook, the fact of the matter is that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds take the last point first.  Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he did nothing about it. Recently \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd when he was president, they attacked. He said they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre just having headaches. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds all it is. We didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do a thing when the attack took place, number one.\nNumber two, we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift.\nNumber three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this guy told Ukraine \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd told Trump, do whatever you want. Do whatever you want. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds exactly what Trump did to Putin, encouraged him, do whatever you want. And he went in.\nAnd listen to what he said when he went in, he was going to take Kyiv in five days, remember? Because it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds part of the old Soviet Union. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what he wanted to re-establish, Kyiv. And he, in fact, didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do it at all. He didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt able to get it done. And they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve lost over \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops.\nBASH:  Thank you.\nPresident Trump\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nTRUMP:  I never said that.\nBASH:  \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to come back to you for one minute. I just want to go back to my original question, which is, are Putin\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds terms acceptable to you, keeping the territory in Ukraine?\nTRUMP:  No, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not acceptable. No, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not acceptable.\nBut look, this is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he led everybody along. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds given $200 billion. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a lot of money. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever been anything like it. Every time that Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the greatest salesman ever.\nAnd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not knocking him, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not knocking anything. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm only saying, the money that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre spending on this war, and we shouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be spending, it should have never happened.\nI will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on January 20th. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll have that war settled.\nPeople being killed so needlessly, so stupidly, and I will get it settled and I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll get it settled fast, before I take office.\nBASH:  President Biden, you have a minute.\nBIDEN:  The fact is that Putin is a war criminal. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds killed thousands and thousands of people. And he has made one thing clear: He wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire. Not just a piece, he wants all of Ukraine. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what he wants.\nAnd then do you think he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll stop there? Do you think he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll stop when he \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd if he takes Ukraine? What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries?\nAnd so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to do. Because if, in fact, he does what he says\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nes. We give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre strong.\nBASH:  Thank you.\nMoving on to the Middle East, in October, Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than a thousand people and taking hundreds of hostages. Among those held and thought to still be alive are five Americans. Israel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds response has killed thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nPresident Biden, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve put forward a proposal to resolve this conflict. But so far, Hamas has not released the remaining hostages and Israel is continuing its military offensive in Gaza.\nSo what additional leverage will you use to get Hamas and Israel to end the war? You have two minutes.\nBIDEN:  Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it.\nThe first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is know \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the end of the war.\nThe only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number one. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre the only ones standing out (ph). We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre still pushing hard from \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd to get them to accept.\nIn the meantime, what\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds happened in Israel? We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre finally \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the only thing I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs. They don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.\nAnd by the way, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown kind of ballistic \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd ballistic missile attack on Israel. No one was hurt. No \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel.\nWe are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre two different things.\nHamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden. You don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have to do it.\nAnd by the way, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened. And they should be. They should be eliminated.\nBut you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers.\nTRUMP:  Just going back to Ukraine for one second, we have an ocean separating us. The European nations together have spent $100 billion, or maybe more than that, less than us. Why doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt he call them so you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The secretary general of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever seen. You wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have any \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they were going out of business. We were spending \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd almost 100 percent of the money was \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it was paid by us.\nHe didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do that. He is getting all \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you got to ask these people to put up the money. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them, because of location, because we have an ocean in between. You got to ask them.\nAs far as Israel and Hamas, Israel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the one that wants to go \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one. And you should them go and let them finish the job.\nHe doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want to do it. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds become like a Palestinian. But they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like him, because he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a very bad Palestinian. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a weak one.\nBASH:  President Biden, you have a minute.\nBIDEN:  I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never heard so much foolishness.\nThis is a guy who wants to get out of NATO. You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to stay in NATO or you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to pull out of NATO?\nThe idea that we have \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd our strength lies in our alliances as well. It may be a big ocean, but we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (inaudible) able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe. What happens if, in fact, you have Putin continue to go into NATO? We have an Article Five agreement, attack on one is attack on all. You want to start the nu\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nay. They asked me that question: Would you guard us against Russia? \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time. And they (sic) said, no, if you don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt pay, I won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do that. And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months.\nBut now, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in the same position. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre paying everybody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bills.\nBASH:  Thank you.\nTAPPER:  Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds turn to the issue of democracy. Former President Trump, I want to ask you about January 6, 2021.\nAfter you rallied your supporters that day, some of them stormed the Capitol to stop the constitutionally mandated counting of electoral votes. As president, you swore an oath to, quote, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdpreserve, protect and defend,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd unquote, the Constitution. What do you say to voters who believe that you violated that oath through your actions and inaction on January 6th and worry that you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll do it again?\nTRUMP:  Well, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think too many believe that.\nAnd let me tell you about January 6th, on January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few. On January 6th, we were energy independent. On January 6th, we had the lowest taxes ever, we had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6th, we were respected all over the world.\nAll over the world we were respected, and then he comes in, and we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre now laughed at, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre like a bunch of stupid people. What happened to the United States\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd reputation under this man\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm sure at some point you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be talking about, where he goes after his political opponent because he can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt beat him fair and square.\nTAPPER:  You have 80 seconds left. My question was: What do you say to those voters who believe that you violated your constitutional oath through your actions, inaction on January 6th, 2021, and worry that you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll do it again?\nTRUMP:  Well, I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically.\nAnd Nancy Pelosi, if you just watch the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a documentary filmmaker, as they say, what she\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds saying, oh, no, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds my responsibility, I was responsible for this. Because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down. And the mayor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in writing, by the way, the mayor. In writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C. They turned it down.\nI offered 10,000 because I could see \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I had virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech. I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to be there on January 6th. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to be there. And I said, you know what? There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a lot of people coming, you could feel it. You could feel it too. And you could feel it. And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever. And I offered it to her. And she now admits that she turned it down. And it was the same day. She was \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know, you can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.\nTAPPER:  President Biden?\nBIDEN:  Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one.\nI sat in that dining room off the Oval Office \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he sat there for three hours, three hours, watching, begging \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve talked about these people being patriots and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and great patrons of America. In fact, he says he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll now forgive them for what they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been convicted. He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd no.\nHe went to every single court in the nation, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know how many cases, scores of cases, including the Supreme Court, and they said they said \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they said, no, no, this guy, this guy is responsible for doing what is being \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd was done.\nHe didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do a damn thing. And these people should be in jail. And they should be the ones who are being held accountable. And he wants to let them all out.\nAnd now he says if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that there could be a bloodbath.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden.\nPresident Trump?\nTRUMP:  What they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, what you have done, how you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve destroyed the lives of so many people.\nWhen they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done there with the fires all over the city. If I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.\nWhen you look at all of the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they took over big chunks of Seattle. I was all set to bring in the National Guard. They heard that, they saw them coming and they left immediately.\nWhat he said about this whole subject is so off. Peacefully patr\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nall of the information they found, because they found out we were right. We were right. And they deleted and destroyed all of the information.\nThey should go to jail for that. If a Republican did that, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd go to jail.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\nPresident Biden, I want to give you a minute.\nBIDEN:  The only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is he is \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds telling you is simply not true.\nThe fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill. And all those people, every one of those who were convicted, deserves to be convicted. The idea that they didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt kill somebody, just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows, occupied offices, turned over desks, turned them over, statues \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the idea that those people are patriots? Come on.\nWhen I asked him, the first of two debates we had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd debates we had the first time around, I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys? He said, no, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll tell them to stand by. The idea he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds refusing \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd will you denounce these guys? Will you denounce the people we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre talking about now? Will you denounce the people who attacked that Capitol? What are you going to do?\nTAPPER:  I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to give you a \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd a minute, President Trump, for a follow-up question I have.\nAfter a jury convicted you of 34 felonies last month, you said if re-elected you would, quote, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhave every right to go after,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd unquote, your political opponents. You just talked about members of the Select Committee on January 6th going to jail.\nYour main political opponent is standing on stage with you tonight. Can you clarify exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after your political opponents?\nTRUMP:  Well, I said my retribution is going to be success. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make this country successful again, beca\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nt let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things.\nBut he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office. Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done horrible things. All of the death caused at the border, telling the Ukrainian people that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor, otherwise, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not getting a billion dollars.\nIf I ever said that, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds quid pro quo. That \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not going to do anything, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor having to do with his son.\nThis man is a criminal. This man \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre lucky. You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre lucky.\nI did nothing wrong. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd have a system that was rigged and disgusting. I did nothing wrong.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\nPresident Biden, you have said \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm coming right to you, sir. You \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd well, you want to respond? Go ahead. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll give you a minute to respond.\nBIDEN:  The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre talking about is outrageous. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds simply a lie, number one.\nNumber two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre a president is wrong, is simply wrong. No president\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever spoken like that before. No president in our history has spoken like that before.\nNumber three, the crimes that you are still charged with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public, for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star on the night \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd while your wife was pregnant?\nI mean, what are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat.\nTAPPER:  Give you a minute, sir.\nTRUMP:  I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have sex with a porn star, number one.\nNumber two, that was a case that was started and moved \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan D.A.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds office to start that case. That case is going to be appealed in one.\nWe had a very terrible judge, a horrible judge, Democrat. The prosecutor were all high-ranking Democrats, appointed people. And the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd both the civil and the criminal.\nHe basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me. But when the public found out about these cases \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd because they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are. But when he \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up way up. You know that because you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre reporting it. And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever taken in in the history of any campaign, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think any campaign has ever taken.\nHundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a scam and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a guy that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds after his political opponent because he can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt win fair and square.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\nPresident Biden, you have said, quote, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDonald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nDo you believe that the tens of millions of Americans who are likely to vote for President Trump will be voting against American democracy?\nBIDEN:  The more they know about what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done, yes. The more they know about what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done.\nAnd there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a lot more coming. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got a lot of cases around the road coming around. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got a whole range of issues he has to face. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what the juries will do, but I do know \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I do know he has a real problem.\nAnd so the fact that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd could you ever think you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre hearing any president say that, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to seek retribution? Do you ever hear any president say that he thought it might be a good idea?\nWhat got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died, I decided \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in Iraq \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd because of Iraq, I said, I wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt going to run again. Until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, people coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd torches and singing the same antisemitic bile they sang when \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd back in Germany.\nAnd what did \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and the young woman got killed. I spoke to the mother. And she \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they asked him, they said, what \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd well, what do you think of those people, the people who \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the one who \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the ones who tried to stop it and the ones who said, I think there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds fine people on both sides?\nWhat American president would ever say Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same antisemitic bile, carrying swastikas, were fine people?\nThis is a guy who says Hitler\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done some good things. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd like to know what they are, the good things Hitler\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what he said.\nThis guy has no sense of American democracy.\nTAPPER:  President Trump?\nTRUMP:  Jake, both of you know that story\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds been totally wiped out. Because when you see the sentence, it said 100 percent exoneration on there. So he just keeps it going.\nHe says he ran because of Charlottesville. He didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt run because of Charlottesville. He ran because it was his last chance at \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not equipped to be president. You know it and I know it.\nIt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ridiculous. We have a debate. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre trying to justify his presidency.\nHis presidency, his \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd without question, the worst president, the worst presidency in the history of our country. We shouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be having a debate about it. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nothing to debate.\nHe made up the Charlottesville story and you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll see it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds debunked all over the place. Every anchor has \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd every reasonable anchor has debunked it.\nAnd just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a nonsense story. He knows that.\nAnd he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run.\nTAPPER:  President Biden?\nBIDEN:  And debunk. It happened. All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time.\nAnd the idea that somehow that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected.\nIf he thought they were good people coming out of that all \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that forest, carrying those \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt deserve to be president, didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt deserve to be president at all.\nAnd the idea that he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds talking about all of this being fabricated, we saw it with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6. We saw the people breaking through the windows. We saw people occupying there.\nHis own vice president \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd look, there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused to endorse him this time. His vice president hasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt endorsed him this time.\nSo, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him?\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden.\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nBASH:  Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Georgia.\nLet\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds talk about persistent challenges you both faced in your first terms, and you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd certainly face again in a second term. President Biden, while black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency, black families still earn far less than white families.\nBlack mothers are still three times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes. And black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you haven\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt made more progress?\nBIDEN:  They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd black unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long, long time. Number three, we find them \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses.\nAnd in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve got to make sure \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in the job market.\nSo there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done a great deal so far and I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not letting up and they know it.\nBASH:  You have 49 seconds left. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far?\nBIDEN:  I say, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started.\nI made sure that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to do a whole lot more for black families.\nBASH:  Thank you. President Trump?\nTRUMP:  And he caused the inflation. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds blaming inflation. And he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds right, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds been very bad. He caused the inflation and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds killing people. They can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt buy groceries anymore. They can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt.\nYou look at the cost of food where it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt live. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not living anymore. He caused this inflation.\nI gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all this money that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds being thrown out the window.\nHe caused inflation. As sure as you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds allowed to come in through the border. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre taking black jobs and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre taking Hispanic jobs and you haven\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt seen it yet, but you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to see something that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to be the worst in our history.\nBASH:  Thank you. President Biden?\nBIDEN:  There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15 percent unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why there was no inflation at the time.\nThere were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved in communities, including minority communities. We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the ACA has increased. I made sure that they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre $8,000 per person in the family to get written off in health care, but this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to try again if they win.\nYou find ourselves in a position where the idea that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not doing it. I put more \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on. But, on inflation, he caused it by his tremendous malfeasance in the way he handled the pandemic.\nBASH:  Thank you. Another persistent challenge is the climate crisis. 2023 was the hottest year in recorded history, and communities across the country are confronting the devastating effects of extreme heat, intensifying wildfires, stronger hurricanes, and rising sea levels.\nFormer President Trump, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve vowed to end your opponent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds climate initiatives. But, will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?\nTRUMP:  Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt, in the 1990s (ph), we can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening.\nBut, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was - incredible, he did a great job, a great Senator fr\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nin the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics.\nBut, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to take the jobs? And it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds already started. And you haven\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt seen anything yet. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a disaster.\nBASH:  38 seconds left, President Trump. Will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?\nTRUMP:  So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually.\nBIDEN:  I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve passed the most extensive, it was the most extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing what any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be able to get those jobs in high tech.\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd out of the Paris Peace Accord \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all t\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nted States. And I ended it because I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want to waste that money because they treat us horribly. We were the only ones \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it was costing us money. Nobody else was paying into it. And it was a disaster.\nBut, everything that he said just now, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll give you an example. I heard him say before insulin, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors. What he is doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in. They want everybody. And look, I have the biggest heart on the stage. I guarantee you that. And I want to take care of people. But, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre destroying our country. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to be taking over Social Security. He is destroying Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\nBIDEN:  Where does that come from? The idea is that we, in fact \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we were the only ones of consequence or not who are not members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything when (ph) we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not able to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the United States can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt get it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds pollution under control? One of the largest polluters in the world, number one. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre making significant progress. By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half. We have \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we have made significant progress. And we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre continuing to make progress.\nWe set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution.\nBut the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds really concerned about \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd about pollution and about climate, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve not seen any indication of that.\nAnd, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay.\nBASH:  Thank you.\nBIDEN:  And, by the way\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nTAPPER:  So every day millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet. For many older Americans, Social Security provides a critical lifeline.\nPresident Biden, if nothing is done to Social Security, seniors will see their benefits cut in just over 10 years. Will you name tonight one specific step that you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre willing to take to keep Social Security solvent?\nBIDEN:  Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre 18 years old.\nThe idea that they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been proposing that everybody, they pay \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd millionaires pay 1 percent \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 1 percent. So no one after \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life.\nTAPPER:  So you still have 82 seconds left. Are there any other measures that you think that would be able to help keep Social Security solvent, or is just \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd is that one enough?\nBIDEN:  Well, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds plenty to cut in Social Security. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well.\nThe idea that we don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a circumstance where 400,000 people \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I mean, 40 million people \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA.\nAnd, by the way, the other thing is we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $70,000 a year, are going to be able to get $15,000 towards their tuition.\nIt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds just \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he just doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds talking about.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden.\nPresident Trump?\nTRUMP:  So I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve dealt with politicians all my life. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been on this side of the equation for the last eight years. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen anybody lie like this guy. He lies \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen it. He could look you in the face. So \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and about so many other things, too.\nAnd we mentioned the laptop, We mentioned \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdRussia, Russia, Russia,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdUkraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd And everything he does is a lie. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds misinformation and disinformation. The \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlosers and suckers\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd story that he made up is a total lie on the military. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a disgrace.\nBut Social Security, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds destroying it. Because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre putting them on to Social Security; they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre putting them on to Medicare, Medicaid. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre putting them in our hospitals. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre taking the place of our citizens.\nThey\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd what they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing to the V.A., to our veterans, is unbelievable. Our veterans are living in the street and these people are living in luxury hotels. He doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds doing. And it \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds really coming back. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen such anger in our country before.\nTAPPER:  President Biden?\nBIDEN:  The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and, by the way, when I said \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsuckers and losers,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he said \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the one that acknowledged that that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one.\nNumber two, the idea that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs, there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing better than any other nation in the world.\nAnd, by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates he talked about being phony, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that, if Trump is re-elected, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre likely to have a recession, and inflation is going to increasingly go up.\nAnd by the way, worst president in history \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 159 presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America.\nTAPPER:  President Biden, thank you so much. Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds turn to the cost of childcare, which many American families struggle to afford.\nPresident Trump, both you and President Biden have tried to address this issue, but the average cost of childcare in this country has risen to more than $11,000 a year per child. For many families, the cost of childcare for two children is more than their rent. In your second term, what would you do to make childcare more affordable?\nTRUMP:  Just to go back. The general got fired because he was no good. And if he said that, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why he made it up. But we have 19 people that said I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say it, and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre very highly respected, much more so than him.\nThe other thing is, he doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt fire people. He never fired people. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp. They were no good. Not easy to fire people. You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd pay a price for it, but they were no good. I inherited these people. I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt put him there. I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt put Comey there. He was no good. I fired him.\nThis guy hasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt fired anybody. He never fires. He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the Afghanistan horror show. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. He didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt fire?\nDid you fire anybody? Did you fire anybody that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds on the border, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world? Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions? Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed? Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be a debate.\nHe is the worst president. He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the worst president in the history of our country. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds destroyed our country. Now, all of a sudden, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds trying to get a little tough on the border. He come out \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit. A little bit, like this much. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds insignificant.\nHe wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we just can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have a chance. Not even a chance of coming out of this rut. We probably won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have a country left anymore. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds how bad it is. He is the worst in history by far.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump. President Biden?\nBIDEN:  We are the most admired country in the world. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre the United States of America. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nd men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work, and we should encourage businesses to hold \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd to have child care facilities.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, the question was about what would you do to make child care more affordable? If you want to take your minute.\nTRUMP:  Just you understand, we have polling. We have other things that do \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they rate him the worst because what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done is so bad. And they rate me \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd yes, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll show you. I will show you. And they rate me one of the best. OK.\nAnd if I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm given another four years, I will be the best. I think I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be the best. Nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever created an economy like us. Nobody ever cut taxes like us. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only one I know. He wants to raise your taxes by four times. He wants to raise everybody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody, including the two of you are going to pay four to five times. Nobody ever heard of this before.\nAll my life I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd grow up and I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd see politicians talking about cutting taxes. When we cut taxes, as I said, we did more business. Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country. The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it.\nTAPPER:  President Biden?\nBIDEN:  Look, the fact of the matter is that he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds dead wrong about it. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds increased the tariff \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds increased \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt.\nBut this tariff, this 10 percent tariffs. Everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say? That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important.\nNumber two, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he somehow helped the middle class. The middle class has been devastated by you. Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next ten years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country. You had the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one.\nNumber two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China. We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden. Thank you, President Biden.\nLet\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds discuss an epidemic impacting millions of Americans that both of you have made a top priority in your first term, the opioid crisis. And for both of you, the number of overdose deaths in this country has gone up. Under your term, it went up. Under your term, it has gone up.\nFormer President Trump, despite the efforts that both of you have made, more than 100,000 Americans are dying from overdoses every year, primarily from fentanyl and other opioids. What will you do to help Americans right now in the throes of addiction, who are struggling to get the treatment they need?\nTRUMP:  To finish up, we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy, we have the largest deficit with China. He gets paid by China. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China. So I think he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds afraid to deal with him or something.\nBut do you notice? He never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China. He never\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nr country and he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got the worst situation with China. China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing to us as a country. They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt let that happen. You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre destroying our country.\nTAPPER:  So, President Trump, you have 67 seconds left. The question was, what are you going to do to help Americans in the throes of addiction right now who are struggling to get the treatment they need?\nTRUMP:  Jake, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along. We had the two-and-a-half, almost three years of like nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever had before, any country in every way. And then we had to get tough. And it was \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the drugs pouring across the border, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it started to increase.\nWe got great equipment. We bought the certain dog. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the most incredible thing that you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever seen, the way they can spot it. We did a lot. And we had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we were getting very low numbers. Very, very low numbers.\nThen he came along. The numbers \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd have you seen the numbers now? It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because the gotaways, they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt even talk about gotaways. But the numbers of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border, the worst thing I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever seen at numbers \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever seen under him because the border is so bad. But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever had by far.\nTAPPER:  President Trump, thank you. President Biden?\nBIDEN:  Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while. And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border, and it costs a lot of money. That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal.\nMore fentanyl machines, were able to detect drugs, more numbers of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border. And when we had that deal done, he went \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he called his Republican colleagues said don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do it. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to hurt me politically.\nHe never argued it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not a good bill. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have the technology to be able to put it together. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what we have to do. We need those machines.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, and again, the question is about Americans in the throes of addiction right now struggling to get the treatment they need.\nTRUMP:  Because this does pertain to it. He ended remain in Mexico, he ended catch and release. I made it catch and release in Mexico, not catch and release here. We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing.\nIt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds just like when you have a hostage, we always pay $6 billion for a \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd every time we sees hostage. Now we have a hostage. A Wall Street Journal reporter, I think a good guy, and he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter.\nI will have him out very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office. I said by literally as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out. He should have had him out a long time ago. But Putin is probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time.\nWe had two cases where we paid $6 billion for five people. I got 58 people out and I paid essentially nothing.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\nDana.\nBASH:  Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds turn to concerns that voters have about each of you.\nPresident Biden, you would be 86 at the end of your second term. How do you address concerns about your capability to handle the toughest job in the world well into your 80s?\nBIDEN:  Well, first of all, I spent half my career being \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate. And now I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm the oldest. This guy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done. Look how I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve turned around the horrible situation he left me.\nAs I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd billions of dollars in private investment and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and enterprises that we are growing. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips. And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product.\nSo I went \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I went to South Korea. I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000. You don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt need a college degree for them. And there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans all over \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd from all over the world.\nBASH:  President Biden, you have 40 seconds left. Would you like to add anything?\nBIDEN:  Yeah, I would. The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I never heard a president talk like this before. We \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre the envy of the world. Name me a single major country president who wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt trade places with the United States of America. For all our problems and all our opportunities, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre the most progressive country in the world in getting things done. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre the strongest country in the world. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre a country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us, all of our allies.\nAnd our \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd those who he cuddles up to, from Kim Jong-un who he sends love letters to, or Putin, et cetera, they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want to screw around with us.\nBASH:  Thank you.\nFormer President Trump, to follow up, you would be 82 at the end of your second term. What do you say to voters who have concerns about your capabilities to serve?\nTRUMP:  Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know. We made it public. He took none. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one. Like go through the first five questions, he couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do it. But I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year. And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. And I do it. He doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do it. He can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match. He can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt hit a ball 50 yards.\nI think I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm a very good shape. I feel that I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago. Actually, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm probably a little bit lighter. But I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm in as good a shape as I was years ago. I feel very good. I feel the same.\nBut I took \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I was willing to take a cognitive test. And you know what, if I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do well \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I aced them. Dr. Ronny Jackson, who\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a great guy, when he was White House doctor. And then I took another one, a similar one, and both \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd one of them said they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd never seen anybody ace them.\nBASH:  Thank you.\nPresident Biden?\nBIDEN:  You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to see he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds six-foot-five and only 225 pounds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd or 235 pounds.\nTRUMP:  (inaudible).\nBIDEN:  Well, you said six-four, 200.\nTRUMP:  (inaudible).\nBIDEN:  Well, anyway, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is.\nLook, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be happy to have a driving contest with him. I got my handicap, which, when I was vice president, down to a 6.\nAnd by the way, I told you before I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?\nTRUMP:  That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the biggest lie that he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a 6 handicap, of all.\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nhat I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds one of the strongest statements you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever seen.\nIn addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that. They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol. And in many cases were ushered in by the police.\nAnd as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine. She said that loud and clear.\nBut the answer is, if the election is fair free, and I want that more than anybody.\nAnd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll tell you something \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I wish he was a great president because I wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be here right now. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be at one of my many places enjoying myself. I wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be under indictment because I wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have been his political appoint \u00ef\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nFive, an attack on one is attack on all, a required response.\nThe idea \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the idea \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt trade places with what job I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done and what they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done because we are a powerful nation, we have wonderful piece (ph), because of the people, not me, because of the American people. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre capable of anything and they step up when they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre needed.\nAnd right now, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre needed. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake.\nAnd again, you want to have war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv, make sure they move on, see what happens in Poland, Hungary, and other places along that border. Then you have a war.\nBASH:  President Trump, as I come back to you for a follow-up. The question was, will you accept the results of this election regard\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nme. And he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to take Ukraine and, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not winning that war.\nHe said, I will never settle until such time \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre running out of people, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre running out of soldiers, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve lost so many people. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds so sad.\nThey\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve lost so many people and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000-years-old, all because of him and stupid decisions.\nRussia would\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never attacked if I were president.\nBASH:  President Trump, the question was, will you accept the results of the election regardless of who wins? Yes or no, please?\nTRUMP:  If it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a fair and legal and good election \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd absolutely. I would have much rather accepted these but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous that if you want, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll have a news conference on it in a week or we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll have another one of these on \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in a week.\nBut I will absolutely \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nothing I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd rather do. It would be much easier for me to do that than I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm running again. I wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds destroying our country.\nI would be very happy to be someplace else, in a nice location someplace. And again, no indictments, no political opponent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds stuff, because it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only way he thinks he can win.\nBut unfortunately, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds driven up by numbers and driven it up to a very high level, because the people understand it.\nBIDEN:  Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds see what your numbers are when this election is over.\nTRUMP:  We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll see.\nBIDEN:  Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds see. You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre a whiner. When you lost the first time, you continued to appeal and appeal to courts all across the country.\nNot one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit, state or local, none.\nBut you continue to promote this lie about somehow there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds all this misrepresentation, all the stealing. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds no evidence of that at all.\nAnd I tell\n\n--- MEASURE-SPAN BREAK ---\n\nhe last time.\nBASH:  We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nTAPPER:  It is now time for the candidates to deliver their closing statements.\nAs predetermined by a coin toss, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to begin with you, President Biden. You have two minutes.\nBIDEN:  We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in his last term.\nWe find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system. I ask anyone out there in the audience, or anyone out watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair?\nThe fact is that I said, nobody even making under $400,000 had a single penny increasing their taxes and it will not. And if I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm reelected, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be the case again.\nBut this guy is \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds increased inflation because of the debacle he left after \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd when he handled the pandemic. And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything that comes into the United States America.\nWhat I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and get rid of the ability of Medicare to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for the ability to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies.\nWell, guess what? We got it \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we got it down to 15 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd how much prescription they need.\nYou know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have to pay the exorbitant prices.\nI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to make that available to every senior, all \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd or go longer. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that.\nWe have \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to make sure we have childcare. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to make sure we do something about what we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country.\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break.\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden.\nPresident Trump, you now have two minutes for your closing statement.\nTRUMP:  Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer. He said we want to do this. We want to do that. We want to get rid of this tax, that tax, but he doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do anything. He doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do.\nAll he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan.\nWe didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt stop \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened.\nIran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do business with the United States. They all passed.\nIran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever.\nAgain, Ukraine should have never happened.\nHe talks about all this stuff, but he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do it. For three-and-a-half years, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living in hell. We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place.\nYou talk about Charlottesville. This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times.\nThe whole country is exploding because of you, because they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt respect you. And they have to respect their president and they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt respect you throughout the world.\nWhat we did was incredible. We re \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history.\nThe reason he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds putting a lot of those regulations back on.\nAll of the things that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done, nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd never seen anything like \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre terminally ill.\nNow, you can go and you can get something. You sign a document. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been trying to get it for 42 years.\nBut you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A.\nSo, all of these things \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a failing nation, but it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not going to be failing anymore. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make it great again.\nBASH:  Thank you, former President Trump, President Biden.",
