A coin toss determined their positions.\n\nEach candidate will have two minutes to answer a question, and one minute each for responses and rebuttals. An additional minute for follow-up, clarification\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 2 (2326-2628) ---\nPPER:  And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump.\n\nGentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds begin the debate. And let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy.\n\nPresident Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices rema\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 3 (2881-3564) ---\ne worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?\n\nBIDEN:  You have to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me.\n\nWe had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be all right.\n\nThe economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible.\n\nAnd so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 4 (3849-4767) ---\nice of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.\n\nThat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt take over.\n\nThe combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in this problem right now.\n\nIn addition to that, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where if you had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do much at all. By the time he left, there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd things had been in chaos. There was (ph) literally chaos.\n\nAnd so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 5 (4943-5942) ---\nhe situation is making \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to get done.\n\nTAPPER:  Thank you.\n\nPresident Trump?\n\nDONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had never done so well. Every \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us.\n\nWe got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt end up in a Great Depression the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd so we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good.\n\nBut the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates; that was a disaster for our\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 6 (6306-6811) ---\ns killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.\n\nTAPPER:  Thank you.\n\nPresident Biden?\n\nBIDEN:  Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only one who thinks that, I think. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know anybody else who thinks it was great \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he had the greatest economy in the world.\n\nAnd, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit lar\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 7 (6954-7262) ---\nn, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant.\n\nAnd the military \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. He didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do anything about that. When he was president, we still found ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 8 (7347-7787) ---\nsn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have any \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this decade \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did.\n\nTAPPER:  President Trump, I want to follow up, if I can. You wanted\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\nTRUMP:  Am I allowed to respond to him?\n\nTAPPER:  Well, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to ask you a follow-up. You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you.\n\nI want to follow up. You want to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. How\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 9 (7868-8421) ---\nto drive them higher. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China and many others, in all fairness to China \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things.\n\nBut he \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he\u00ef\u00bf\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 10 (8570-8874) ---\nt stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership, because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what they were doing. And they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what they were doing. It was the worst \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd probably the worst administration in history. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds never been.\n\nAnd as\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 11 (9249-9622) ---\nn-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt. While so far, President Biden, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.\n\nSo former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say. With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 12 (9752-10054) ---\nurred the greatest economy that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that tax spurred.\n\nNow, when we cut the taxes \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd as an example, the corporate tax was\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 13 (10158-10610) ---\nand companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country.\n\nThe country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation, with all of the therapeutics and all of\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 14 (10749-11120) ---\nad largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration.\n\nHe did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thin\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 15 (11332-11791) ---\nntry. They don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt respect our leadership. They don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt respect the United States anymore.\n\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre like a Third World nation. Between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent, all of the things he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve become like a Third World nation. And it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a shame the damage he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done to our country.\n\nAnd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 16 (12196-12807) ---\nt I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to do is fix the taxes.\n\nFor example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I mean, billionaires in America. And what\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds happening? They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd raised $500 million \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.\n\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be able to right \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd wipe out his debt. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be able to help make sure that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all those things we need to do, childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure t\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 17 (12882-13304) ---\n\u00bdve been able to do with the COVID \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with.\n\nLook, if \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we finally beat Medicare.\n\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden.\n\nPresident Trump?\n\nTRUMP:  Well, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds right: He did beat Medicaid (ph). He beat it to death. And he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds destroying Medicare, because all of these people are coming in, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre putting them on Medicare, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre putting them on Social Securi\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 18 (13474-14099) ---\ntrying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence, and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a shame.\n\nWhat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre no longer respected. They don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like us. We give them everything they want, and they \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they think we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre stupid. They think we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre very stupid people.\n\nWhat we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us. What this ma\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 19 (14871-15175) ---\nrtion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.\n\nAnd if you look at this whole question that you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre asking, a complex, but not really complex \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception.\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 20 (15398-16382) ---\nde and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.\n\nNow, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd getting into other things, But every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that.\n\nNow the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the vote of the people.\n\nLike Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds important to believe in the exceptions. Some people \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you have to follow your heart. Some people don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the li\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 21 (16651-16955) ---\nlife of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd after birth.\n\nIf you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll put the baby aside and we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll kill the baby.\n\nWhat happened is we\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 22 (17596-18021) ---\nour circumstances are, whether you need help.\n\nThe idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to turn civil rights back to the states, let each state have a different rule.\n\nLook, there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds so many young women who have been \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd by \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd by an immigrant coming in and (inaudible) tal\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 23 (18768-19315) ---\noncerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting and in many cases, they \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds, frankly, a very liberal decision. In many cases, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the opposite.\n\nBut they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre voting and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt, but they would have \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd everybody want it brought back.\n\nRonald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt able to get it.\n\nEverybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tri\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 24 (19905-20211) ---\nr. Second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation. A third time is between the doctor \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I mean, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be between the woman and the state.\n\nThe idea that the politicians \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a woman\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds health is ridiculous. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 25 (20350-20905) ---\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to do.\n\nAnd if I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm elected, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to restore Roe v. Wade.\n\nTRUMP:  So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat-run, take it after birth. Again, the governor \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd former governor of Virginia:  put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it.\n\nSo he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.\n\nNobody wants that to happen. Democrat or Republican, nobody wants it to happen.\n\nBIDEN:\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 26 (21483-21788) ---\ncans.\n\nBIDEN:  For 51 years, that was the law. 51 years, constitutional scholarship said it was the right way to go. 51 years. And it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. Takes credit for taking it away.\n\nWhat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds he going to do? What\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds he going to do, in\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 27 (22743-23336) ---\nr police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers. Significantly \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd by the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me, endorsed my position.\n\nIn addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not the right way to go.\n\nWhat I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd since I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve changed the law, what\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds happened? I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve changed it in a way that now you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 28 (23624-23928) ---\nn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think he knows what he said either.\n\nLook, we had the safest border in the history of our country. The border \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all he had to do was leave it. All he had to do was leave it.\n\nHe decided to open up our border, open up our country to people\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 29 (23985-24290) ---\nutions, insane asylum, terrorists. We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists, all over the world \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere. All over the world, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre pouring in. And this guy just left\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 30 (24441-24997) ---\nfinal couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd who is great, and, by the way, who endorsed me for president. But I won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say that. But they endorsed me for president.\n\nBrandon, just speak to him.\n\nBut, look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds never been anything like it. And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans.\n\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\n\nPresident Biden?\n\nBIDEN:  The only terrorist who has done anyt\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 31 (25799-26101) ---\nuding those whose spouses are citizens, and including those who have lived here for decades? And if so, how will you do it?\n\nTRUMP:  Can I get one second?\n\nHe said we killed three people. The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Salamani (sic), the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 32 (26262-26567) ---\nof thousands of people dying, and also killing our citizens when they come in. We \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we are living right now in a rat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nest. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union, because we don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have borders anymore. Every state is now a border.\n\nAnd because of his\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 33 (26760-27064) ---\nThey\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre killing our citizens at a level that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen before. And you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days. One of them, I just spoke to the mother, and we just had the funeral for this girl, 12 years old.\n\nThis is horrible what\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taken place. Wh\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 34 (27150-27828) ---\noesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want it to be. He just doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know. He opened the borders nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever seen anything like. And we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast, because they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to destroy our country.\n\nJust take a look at where they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places. Our veterans are on the street, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre dying, because he doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt care about our veterans. He doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt care. He doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like the military at all. And he doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt care about our veterans.\n\nNobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds been worse. I had the highest approval rating for veterans, taking care of the V.A. He has the worst.

But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\n\nTRUMP:  \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all of these people to come in.\n\nTAPPER:  President Biden\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\nTRUMP:  And it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a very sad day in America.\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 36 (29472-30743) ---\nde-up quote, suckers and losers. They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds failing, like many of these magazines. He made that up. He put it in commercials. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve notified them. We had 19 people that said I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say it.\n\nAnd think of this, who would say \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm at a cemetery, or I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm talking about our veterans \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd because nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taken better care \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm so glad this came up, and he brought it up. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nobody that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taken better care of our soldiers than I have.\n\nTo think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we have 19 people that said it was never said by me. It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up, just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking.\n\nIt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the same thing. Fifty-one intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation. It wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt. That came from his son Hunter. It wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt Russia disinformation. He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now.\n\nBIDEN:  You had a four-star general stand at your side, who was on your staff, who said you said it, period. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds number one.\n\nAnd, number two, the idea \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the idea that I have to apologiz\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 37 (31114-31433) ---\nV.A. is doing now. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.\n\nTAPPER:  All right. Thank you so much.\n\nBASH:  Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds move to the topic of foreign policy. I want to begin with Russia\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds war against Ukraine, which is now in its third year.\n\nFormer President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Put\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 38 (31740-33574) ---\nt commander in chief, if that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what you call him, that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever had. They can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt stand him. So let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds get that straight.\n\nAnd they like me more than just about any of them. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds based on every single bit of information.\n\nAs far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that was respected by Putin, he would have never \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he would have never invaded Ukraine.\n\nA lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know. You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers. He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.\n\nI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned, and so he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals.\n\nNo general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind, we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And by the way, we left people behind too. We left American citizens behind.\n\nWhen Putin saw that, he said, you know what? I think we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to go in and maybe take my \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never.\n\nJust like Israel would have never been invaded, in a million years, by Hamas. You know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 39 (33653-33993) ---\nlace, the whole world is blowing up under him.\n\nBASH:  President Biden?\n\nBIDEN:  I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never heard so much malarkey in my whole life.\n\nLook, the fact of the matter is that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds take the last point first.  Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he di\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 40 (34252-34556) ---\nhanistan during that airlift.\n\nNumber three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this guy told Ukraine \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd told Trump, do whatever you want. Do whatever you want. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds exactly what Trump did to Putin, encouraged him, do whatever yo\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 41 (35179-35741) ---\nthe territory in Ukraine?\n\nTRUMP:  No, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not acceptable. No, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not acceptable.\n\nBut look, this is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he led everybody along. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds given $200 billion. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a lot of money. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever been anything like it. Every time that Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the greatest salesman ever.\n\nAnd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not knocking him, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not knocking anything. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm only saying, th\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 42 (35913-36230) ---\ndent-elect before I take office on January 20th. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll have that war settled.\n\nPeople being killed so needlessly, so stupidly, and I will get it settled and I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll get it settled fast, before I take office.\n\nBASH:  President Biden, you have a minute.\n\nBIDEN:  The fact is that Putin is a war criminal. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds killed\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 43 (36547-36992) ---\nappens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries?\n\nAnd so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to do. Because if, in fact, he does what he says and walks away \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd by the way, all that money we give Ukraine and weapons we make here in the United States. We give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 44 (37355-37769) ---\nian crisis in Gaza.\n\nPresident Biden, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve put forward a proposal to resolve this conflict. But so far, Hamas has not released the remaining hostages and Israel is continuing its military offensive in Gaza.\n\nSo what additional leverage will you use to get Hamas and Israel to end the war? You have two minutes.\n\nBIDEN:  Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 t\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 45 (38284-39297) ---\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre finally \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the only thing I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs. They don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.\n\nAnd by the way, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown kind of ballistic \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd ballistic missile attack on Israel. No one was hurt. No \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel.\n\nWe are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre two different things.\n\nHamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden. You don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have to do it.\n\nAnd by the way, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened. And they should be. They should be eliminated.\n\nBut you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers.\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 46 (39401-39737) ---\ntogether have spent $100 billion, or maybe more than that, less than us. Why doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt he call them so you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The secretary general of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever seen. You wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have a\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 47 (40251-40933) ---\none. And you should them go and let them finish the job.\n\nHe doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want to do it. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds become like a Palestinian. But they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like him, because he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a very bad Palestinian. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a weak one.\n\nBASH:  President Biden, you have a minute.\n\nBIDEN:  I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never heard so much foolishness.\n\nThis is a guy who wants to get out of NATO. You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to stay in NATO or you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to pull out of NATO?\n\nThe idea that we have \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd our strength lies in our alliances as well. It may be a big ocean, but we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (inaudible) able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe. What happens if, in fact, you have Putin continue to go into NATO? We have an Article Five ag\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 48 (41103-41571) ---\nd and other places. See what happens then.\n\nHe has no idea what the hell he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds talking about.\n\nAnd by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this was \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace. No \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd no major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe.\n\nBASH:  President Trump, just to follow up, would you suppo\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 49 (41668-41970) ---\nMP:  I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd have to see.\n\nBut before we do that, the problem we have is that we spend all the money. So they kill us on trade. I made great trade deals with the European nations, because if you add them up, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre about the same size economically. Their economy is about the same size as the United S\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 50 (42256-42860) ---\nes with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds right about this, I said, no, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not going to support NATO if you don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt pay. They asked me that question: Would you guard us against Russia? \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time. And they (sic) said, no, if you don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt pay, I won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do that. And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months.\n\nBut now, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in the same position. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre paying everybody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bills.\n\nBASH:  Thank you.\n\nTAPPE\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 51 (43281-43637) ---\noath through your actions and inaction on January 6th and worry that you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll do it again?\n\nTRUMP:  Well, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think too many believe that.\n\nAnd let me tell you about January 6th, on January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few. On January 6th, we were energy independent.

What happened to the United States\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd reputation under this man\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm sure at some point you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be talking about\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 53 (44248-44552) ---\nthrough your actions, inaction on January 6th, 2021, and worry that you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll do it again?\n\nTRUMP:  Well, I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically.\n\nAnd Nancy Pelosi, if you just watch the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a documentary filmmaker, as the\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 54 (44658-45301) ---\nd her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down. And the mayor of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in writing, by the way, the mayor. In writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C. They turned it down.\n\nI offered 10,000 because I could see \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I had virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech. I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to be there on January 6th. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to be there. And I said, you know what? There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a lot of people coming, you could feel it. You could feel it too. And you could feel it. And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever. And I offered it to her. And s\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 55 (45460-46035) ---\no a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.\n\nTAPPER:  President Biden?\n\nBIDEN:  Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one.\n\nI sat in that dining room off the Oval Office \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he sat there for three hours, three hours, watching, begging \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve talked about these people being patriots and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and great patrons of America. In fact, he says he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll now forgive th\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 56 (46660-48175) ---\nThank you, President Biden.\n\nPresident Trump?\n\nTRUMP:  What they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, what you have done, how you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve destroyed the lives of so many people.\n\nWhen they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd you go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done there with the fires all over the city. If I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.\n\nWhen you look at all of the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they took over big chunks of Seattle. I was all set to bring in the National Guard. They heard that, they saw them coming and they left immediately.\n\nWhat he said about this whole subject is so off. Peacefully patriotic.\n\nOne other thing, the unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now, out of office, and Democrats, all Democrats, they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found, because they found out we were right. We were right. And they deleted and destroyed all of the information.\n\nThey should go to jail for that. If a Republican did that, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd go to jail.\n\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Trump.\n\nPresident Biden, I want to give you a minute.\n\nBIDEN:  The only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is he is \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds telling you is simply not true.\n\nThe fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill. And all those\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 57 (48947-49699) ---\nury convicted you of 34 felonies last month, you said if re-elected you would, quote, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhave every right to go after,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd unquote, your political opponents. You just talked about members of the Select Committee on January 6th going to jail.\n\nYour main political opponent is standing on stage with you tonight. Can you clarify exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after your political opponents?\n\nTRUMP:  Well, I said my retribution is going to be success. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make this country successful again, because right now it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a failing nation. My retribution\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to be success.\n\nBut when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon at a very high level. His son is convicted.

You \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd well, you want to respond? Go ahead. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll give you a minute to respond.\n\nBIDEN:  The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre talking about is outrageous. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds simply a lie, number one.\n\nNumber two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre a president is wrong, is simply wrong. No president\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever spoken like that before. No president in our history has spoken like that before.\n\nNumber three, the crimes that you are still charged with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public, for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star on the night \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd while your wife was pregnant?\n\nI mean, what are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat.\n\nTAPPER:  Give you a minute, sir.\n\nTRUMP:  I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have sex with a porn star, number one.\n\nNumber two, that was a case that was st\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 59 (52222-52586) ---\ne has no idea what these cases are. But when he \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up way up. You know that because you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre reporting it. And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever taken in in the history of any campaign, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think any campaign has ever taken.\n\nHundreds o\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 60 (53316-53622) ---\no face. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what the juries will do, but I do know \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I do know he has a real problem.\n\nAnd so the fact that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd could you ever think you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre hearing any president say that, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to seek retribution? Do you ever hear any president say that he thought it might be a good idea?\n\nWhat got\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 61 (53989-54293) ---\nthe young woman got killed. I spoke to the mother.

I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd like to know what they are, the good things Hitler\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what he said.\n\nThis guy has no sense of American democracy.\n\nTAPPER:  President Trump?\n\nTRUMP:  Jake, both of you know that story\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds been totally wiped out. Because when you see the sentence, it said 100 percent exoneration on there. So he just keeps it going.\n\nHe says he ran because of Charlottesville. He didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt run because of Charlottesville. He ran because it was his last chance at \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not equipped to be president. You know it and I know it.\n\nIt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ridiculous. We have a debate. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre trying to justify his presidency.\n\nHis presidency, his \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd without question, the worst president, the worst presidency in the history o\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 63 (55738-56042) ---\ntime.\n\nAnd the idea that somehow that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected.\n\nIf he thought they were good people coming out of that all \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that forest, carrying those \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt deserve to be president\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 64 (56226-56828) ---\nthe people breaking through the windows.

His vice president hasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt endorsed him this time.\n\nSo, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him?\n\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden.\n\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBASH:  Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Georgia.\n\nLet\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds talk about persistent challenges you both faced in\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 65 (58222-59026) ---\nprotections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in the job market.\n\nSo there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done a great deal so far and I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not letting up and they know it.\n\nBASH:  You have 49 seconds left. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far?\n\nBIDEN:  I say, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly.

He caused the inflation and it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds killing people. They can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt buy groceries anymore. They can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt.\n\nYou look at the cost of food where it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt live. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not living anymore. He caused this inflation.\n\nI gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd all this money that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds being thrown out the window.\n\nHe caused inflation. As sure as you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 67 (60459-60767) ---\nstory.\n\nBASH:  Thank you. President Biden?\n\nBIDEN:  There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15 percent unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why there was no inflation at the time.\n\nThere were no jobs. We pr\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 68 (61948-62260) ---\nlimate initiatives. But, will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?\n\nTRUMP:  Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump, almost every police group. And\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 69 (62674-62982) ---\nd universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was - incredible, he did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds one of the most successful economic development acts\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 70 (63255-63854) ---\ns done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics.\n\nBut, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to take the jobs? And it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds already started. And you haven\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt seen anything yet. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a disaster.\n\nBASH:  38 seconds left, President Trump. Will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?\n\nTRUMP:  So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everyt\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 71 (64161-65180) ---\nwas the most extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing what any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be able to get those jobs in high tech.\n\nWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd out of the Paris Peace Accord \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done.\n\nTRUMP:  The Paris Accord was going\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 72 (65705-66009) ---\nis destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in. They want everybody. And look, I have the biggest heart on the stage. I guarantee you that. And I want to take care of people. But, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre destroying our country. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre g\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 73 (66603-67546) ---\nWe set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution.\n\nBut the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds really concerned about \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd about pollution and about climate, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve not seen any indication of that.\n\nAnd, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay.\n\nBASH:  Thank you.\n\nBIDEN:  And, by the way\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\n\nTAPPER:  So every day millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet. For many older Americans, Social Security provides a critical lifeline.\n\nPresident Biden, if nothing is done to Social Security, senio\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 74 (67670-69667) ---\nto keep Social Security solvent?\n\nBIDEN:  Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre 18 years old.\n\nThe idea that they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been proposing that everybody, they pay \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd millionaires pay 1 percent \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 1 percent. So no one after \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life.\n\nTAPPER:  So you still have 82 seconds left. Are there any other measures that you think that would be able to help keep Social Security solvent, or is just \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd is that one enough?\n\nBIDEN:  Well, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds plenty to cut in Social Security. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well.\n\nThe idea that we don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a circumstance where 400,000 people \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I mean, 40 million people \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA.\n\nAnd, by the way, the other thing is we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 75 (69780-70322) ---\n\u00bdt know what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds talking about.\n\nTAPPER:  Thank you, President Biden.\n\nPresident Trump?\n\nTRUMP:  So I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve dealt with politicians all my life. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been on this side of the equation for the last eight years. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen anybody lie like this guy. He lies \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen it. He could look you in the face. So \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and about so many other things, too.\n\nAnd we mentioned the laptop, We mentioned \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdRussia, Russia, Russia,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdUkraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd And everything he does is a lie. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds misinformation and disinforma\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 76 (71024-71334) ---\ndent Biden?\n\nBIDEN:  The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and, by the way, when I said \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsuckers and losers,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he said \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the one that acknowledged that that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds what he said. He\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 77 (71691-72412) ---\nost successful economy in the world. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing better than any other nation in the world.\n\nAnd, by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates he talked about being phony, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that, if Trump is re-elected, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre likely to have a recession, and inflation is going to increasingly go up.\n\nAnd by the way, worst president in history \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 159 presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America.\n\nTAPPER:  President Biden, thank you so much. Let\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds turn to the cost of childcare, which many American families struggle to afford.\n\nPresident Trump, both you and President Biden have tried to address this issue, but the average cost of\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 78 (72763-73065) ---\n. But we have 19 people that said I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say it, and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre very highly respected, much more so than him.\n\nThe other thing is, he doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt fire people. He never fired people. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top pe\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 79 (73957-74520) ---\nhouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be a debate.\n\nHe is the worst president. He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the worst president in the history of our country. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds destroyed our country. Now, all of a sudden, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds trying to get a little tough on the border. He come out \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit. A little bit, like this much. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds insignificant.\n\nHe wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt think \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we just can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt let it happ\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 80 (75096-75400) ---\n. Number one.\n\nNumber two, the idea that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre talking about worst presidents. I wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt hold me to the exact number, presidential historians. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve had meetings and they voted who\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the worst president in American history. One through best to w\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 81 (76150-76884) ---\nhave polling. We have other things that do \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they rate him the worst because what he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds done is so bad. And they rate me \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd yes, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll show you. I will show you. And they rate me one of the best. OK.\n\nAnd if I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm given another four years, I will be the best. I think I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be the best. Nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever created an economy like us. Nobody ever cut taxes like us. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the only one I know. He wants to raise your taxes by four times. He wants to raise everybody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody, including the two of you are going to pay four to five times. Nobody ever heard of this before.\n\nAll my life I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd grow up and I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd see politicians talking about cutting taxes. When we cu\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 82 (77004-77641) ---\nThe worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it.\n\nTAPPER:  President Biden?\n\nBIDEN:  Look, the fact of the matter is that he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds dead wrong about it. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds increased the tariff \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds increased \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt.\n\nBut this tariff, this 10 percent tariffs. Everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say? That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important.\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 83 (78603-79340) ---\noverdoses every year, primarily from fentanyl and other opioids. What will you do to help Americans right now in the throes of addiction, who are struggling to get the treatment they need?\n\nTRUMP:  To finish up, we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy, we have the largest deficit with China. He gets paid by China. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China. So I think he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds afraid to deal with him or something.\n\nBut do you notice? He never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China. He never took them away. He can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt because it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds too much money. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds tremendous. And we saved our steel industries. And there was more to com\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 84 (79679-80308) ---\ng us as a country, Joe, and you can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt let that happen. You\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre destroying our country.\n\nTAPPER:  So, President Trump, you have 67 seconds left. The question was, what are you going to do to help Americans in the throes of addiction right now who are struggling to get the treatment they need?\n\nTRUMP:  Jake, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along. We had the two-and-a-half, almost three years of like nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever had before, any country in every way. And then we had to get tough. And it was \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the drugs pouring across the border, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd it started to increase.\n\nWe got great equipment. We\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 85 (80802-81104) ---\nhe worst thing I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve ever seen at numbers \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever seen under him because the border is so bad.

He ended remain in Mexico, he ended catch and release. I made it catch and release in Mexico, not catch and release here. We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing.\n\nIt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds just like when you have a hostage, we always pay $6 billion for a \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd every time we sees hostage.

How do you address concerns about your capability to handle the toughest job in the world well into your 80s?\n\nBIDEN:  Well, first of all, I spent half my career being \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate. And now I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm the oldest. This guy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done. Look how I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve turned around the horrible situation he left me.\n\nAs I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd billions of dollars in private investment and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and enterprises that we are growing. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips. And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product.\n\nSo I went \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I went to South Korea. I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000. You don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt need a college degree for them. And there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans all over \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd from all over the world.\n\nBASH:  President Biden, you have 40 seconds left. Would you like to add anything?\n\nBIDEN:  Yeah, I would. The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I never heard a president talk like this before. We \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre the envy of the world. Name me a single major country president who wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt trade places with the United States of America.

What do you say to voters who have concerns about your capabilities to serve?\n\nTRUMP:  Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know. We made it public. He took none. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one. Like go through the first five questions, he couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do it. But I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year. And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smar\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 89 (86647-86983) ---\nago. I feel very good.

Will you pledge tonight that once all legal challenges have been exhausted that you will accept the results of this election regardless of who wins and you will say right now that political violence in any form is unacceptable?\n\nTRUMP:  Well, I shouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have to say that, but, of course, I believe that. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds totally unacceptable.\n\nTRUMP:  And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement tha\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 91 (88952-89875) ---\ndy.\n\nAnd I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll tell you something \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I wish he was a great president because I wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be here right now.

Because he indicted me because I was his opponent.\n\nI wish he was a great president. I would rather have that.\n\nI wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be here. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt mind being here, but the only reason I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm here is he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds so bad as a president that I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to make America great again.

And we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre a failing nation because of him.\n\nHis policies are so bad. His military policies are insane. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre insane.\n\nThese are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre closer to World War Three than anybody can ima\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 92 (90698-91003) ---\nof the American people. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre capable of anything and they step up when they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre needed.\n\nAnd right now, we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre needed. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake.\n\nAnd again, you want to have war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv, make sure they move on, see what\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 93 (91432-92359) ---\nknew not to do it. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not going to play games with me. He knew that. I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games.\n\nHe took nothing from me, but now, he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to take the whole thing from this man right here.\n\nThat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a war that should have never started. It would\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never started ever with me. And he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds going to take Ukraine and, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not winning that war.\n\nHe said, I will never settle until such time \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre running out of people, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre running out of soldiers, they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve lost so many people. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds so sad.\n\nThey\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve lost so many people and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000-years-old, all because of him and stupid decisions.\n\nRussia would\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never attacked if I were president.\n\nB\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 94 (93921-94226) ---\nou can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt stand the loss. Something snapped in you when you lost the last time.\n\nBASH:  We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nTAPPER:  It is now time for the candidates to deliver their closing statements.\n\nAs predetermined by a coin tos\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 95 (95262-95766) ---\nr the ability to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies.\n\nWell, guess what? We got it \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we got it down to 15 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd how much prescription they need.\n\nYou know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have to pay the exorbitant prices.\n\nI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm going to make that available to\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 96 (96280-96918) ---\nu, President Biden.\n\nPresident Trump, you now have two minutes for your closing statement.\n\nTRUMP:  Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer. He said we want to do this. We want to do that. We want to get rid of this tax, that tax, but he doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do anything. He doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do.\n\nAll he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan.\n\nWe didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt stop \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened.\n\nIran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, i\n\n--- COMPRESSED SEGMENT 97 (97830-98764) ---\nregulations back on.\n\nAll of the things that we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve done, nobody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ever \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd never seen anything like \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre terminally ill.\n\nNow, you can go and you can get something. You sign a document. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been trying to get it for 42 years.\n\nBut you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre living. And that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A.\n\nSo, all of these things \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd we\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre in a failing nation, but it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds not going to be failing anymore. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre going to make it great again.\n\nBASH:  Thank you, former President Trump, President Biden.",
